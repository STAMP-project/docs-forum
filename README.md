STAMP project public documents and discussions.

STAMP project contains several technical repositories, corresponding to tools you can use.
We'd like to use the issues of those technical repositories to manage the development and the technical suport on this tools (defects, improvement, change requests, etc).

And so this repository is dedicated to...everything else ! :-)

More general discussion about the project, technologies relative to the project, feedback, etc. You can also find the public deliverables in the "docs" directory.

Please comment, react or create an issue to start a discussion! :-)

And don't forget to watch this repository to be kept updated. ;-)
