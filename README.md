STAMP project public documents and discussions.

STAMP project contains several technical repositories, corresponding to tools you can use.
We'd like to save the issues of those technical repository to manage the direct support on this tools (defects, change requests, etc).

And so this repository is dedicated to...everything else ! :-)
